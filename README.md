# 💰 CS50 Finance – Final Project by Vinicio Zacheu

This is my final project for **Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science**, completed in 2024.

## 🧠 About the Project

**C$50 Finance** is a web-based application that simulates a stock trading platform. Users can register, get stock quotes, buy and sell shares, and track their portfolio and transaction history — all in real time.

This project was built using Python (Flask), SQLite, and the CS50 library, and it's fully functional with session management, authentication, and a clean Bootstrap-powered interface.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔐 **Register/Login** – Secure user authentication system  
- 📈 **Quote Stock Prices** – Lookup stock info by symbol  
- 💸 **Buy/Sell Stocks** – Trade based on real-time prices  
- 🧾 **Transaction History** – Track every stock movement  
- 📊 **Dashboard** – See your portfolio value update live  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Clean layout with Bootstrap  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** + **Flask**  
- **SQLite** (via CS50's SQL library)  
- **HTML + CSS** (Bootstrap 5)  
- **Jinja2** templates  
- **Yahoo Finance API (simulated)**

###What I Learned###
This project pushed me to apply core CS concepts like:

Web development (Flask)

SQL and relational databases

Authentication and sessions

API design and response parsing

Clean code practices and debugging

It was a major step in my transition from operations management to tech — and I’m excited for what’s next.
